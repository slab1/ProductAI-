# 🔑 Supabase CLI Login Instructions

## Step 1: Run Login Command
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
supabase login
```

## Step 2: Complete Browser Authentication
- This command will open your default web browser
- Log in to your Supabase account if not already logged in
- Authorize the CLI to access your account
- Copy the access token that starts with `sbp_`

## Step 3: Provide the Token
Once you have the access token (format: `sbp_...`), paste it here and I'll complete the deployment of your 7 AI Edge Functions.

## ⚠️ Important Notes:
- The token must start with `sbp_`
- Don't share this token publicly - it's your authentication credential
- The token will look like: `sbp_010203...abcdef`

## 🎯 What Happens Next:
After you provide the correct token, I'll:
1. Link to your project (tdvhmmrvxlwaocfcvdls)
2. Configure your OpenAI API key as a secret
3. Deploy all 7 AI Edge Functions
4. Test everything to ensure it's working

Ready when you are! 🚀
